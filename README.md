## **Introduction**
We present a new experiment platform to address this gap by allowing controlled study of human-AI and human-human teams in a creative task. We have created a cooperative version of the classic Alternate Uses Test (AUT; Guilford, 1967), where the goal is to produce as many original and practical creative uses for an everyday object as possible within a time limit. Our platform allows co-players to interact freely during the ideation stage before choosing their personal responses during the curation step. Our original webapp allows identical procedures to be used for human-human and human-AI pairs and experimental controls to be applied to the chat. The results can be evaluated using the same procedures as in the standard individual test of creativity. We currently use GPT-4 as the AI agent, but the platform‚Äôs modularity allows us to replace it with more or less advanced algorithms as needed.
## **Motivation**
An emerging consensus in the cognitive sciences states that flexible, adaptive behavior (i.e., intelligence) does not come from individuals alone, but rather often reflects the competent incorporation of knowledge and skills from one‚Äôs community (Sloman & Fernbach, 2018). For instance, research identifies the ability to successfully coordinate with one‚Äôs team members, called their collective intelligence (CI), as a much better predictor of group outcomes than individual IQs (Riedl et al., 2022). Although creativity is an increasingly important manifestation of intelligence in the information economy, creativity research has not kept up with this collective shift in the cognitive sciences.
